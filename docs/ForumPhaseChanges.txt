This describes a 'traditional' forum with an RFP timeline. Some forums have the same deadline for close of submission & editing, others are ongoing discussions, etc.

If the phases have deadlines, the active one will change automatically. If not, manually change by editing the group (in Home Page Intro section). [Group admin should do this...] 

*Post Submission Close*
Edit the forum group: In the Logo field (Header section) change the css rule to hide the Add post button & other content related to submission, as instructed within the field content.
Go to /admin/config/group/permissions/node/opg_group & remove *create* permission for the content type used by the group, for both members & non-members.

*Post Editing Close*
[Group admin] Bulk Updates: change all post status values to 'In Review' 
Go to /admin/config/group/permissions/node/opg_group & remove *edit* permission for the content type used by the group, for both members & non-members.

*Awards*
[Group admin] Bulk Updates: change all post status values to 'Awarded' or 'Review Complete' (determined by sponsor)
[Group admin should revise intro text.]
On the site home page, move forum link to Implementation section after a few days.

*Archival*

On the site home page, move the link to the forum into the archived section, and adjust the placement of the 'see all' html.

Edit the forum group:
* Home Page Intro > Introductory Text: Add the archive div (copy html from another archived group opp; you need to switch to Full HTML format temporarily) . Make any edits needed to make it clear that the opportunity is complete.
* Home Page Intro > Link to Details: remove value
* Text Blocks > Navblock: Get rid of the Read Before Applying list item, commenting item, & subscription item. 
* Header > Logo:  Add css to hide the timeline on the main view:  .proposal-content .timeline { display: none; }

Bulk Updates:
Switch to comments hidden & terminate voting for all posts, if that hasn't already been done .

Configuration > System > Subscriptions:
Add the forum to the Blocked list
